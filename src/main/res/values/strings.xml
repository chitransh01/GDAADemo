      GDAADemo has 3 functions:\n\n

      1/ UPLOAD (upload icon) invokes a camera and the resulting thumbnail is uploaded to
         Google Drive, creating a simple tree directory structure in the process.\n
         The createTree)() method allows for testing of different CRUD primitives (search,
         create folder, etc…) in the process.\n\n
      2/ DOWNLOAD (download icon) scans the tree created by the createTree method. If the
         object is a file (jpg), it\'s metadata is updated (description field) and the content
         is downloaded (and dumped) - only the number of bytes and dimensions are reported.\n\n
      3/ DELETE (X - delete) scans the tree created by the createTree method and deletes all the
         files and folders in the process\n
