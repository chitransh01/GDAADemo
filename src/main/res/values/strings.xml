      GDAADemo has only 2 functions:\n\n

      1/ UPLOAD (upload icon) will invoke a camera and the resulting picture is uploaded to
      Google Drive, creating a simple tree directory structure in the process.
      The createTreeGDAA/createTreeREST methods allow to test different methods
      (search, create folder, …) in the process.\n\n

      2/ DOWNLOAD (download icon) scans the tree created by GDAADemo
      (testTreeGDAA/testTreeREST methods). If the object is a file (jpg), it\'s metadata
      is updated (description field) and the content is downloaded (and dumped)
      - only the number of bytes is reported. \n\n
